Installation with make
======================

When you downloaded the tarball of this software, after unpacking you will find
a file called "Makefile" in the packages root directory. This means, there's
something you can do with an utility called "make" - which normally is used in
the build process for compiling source code to binaries. It can be (and also is)
used for (un)installation of the (compiled) software - and that's what this
document is about.

Please keep in mind that the Makefile was written for use with Linux. So this
process will probably work with other Unix alike systems (*BSD, Solaris, AIX,
etc.) as well - but for sure not with e.g. Windows (except maybe with Cygwin).

Configuration
-------------

As shipped, the configuration usually is such that the files would be installed
as follows:

Executables go to /usr/local/bin
Configuration files go to /etc
Documentation goes to /usr/local/share/doc/<packagename>

For web apps, the installation goes to /usr/local/share/<packagename>, and this
directory will be linked to /var/www/<packagename> - if this directory/file/link
does not yet exist.

If you want to install to a different location, you may change some variables at
the top of the Makefile. Usually, these are:

prefix=/usr/local		Path for the executables is derived from this
datarootdir=$(prefix)/share	Path for webapps and documentation uses this
sysconfdir=/etc			Path for configuration files
WEBROOT=/var/www		Just for webapps: Where to create a link

You may as well check the other settings, but these three are the most
important for you. You could also override these on the command line, e.g.
with "make prefix=/opt install" - but I don't recommend that if you want to
run a "make uninstall" later, since you may forget what options you used on the
install.


Installation
------------

Once the configuration is done, installation is as easy as invoking

	make install

from within the directory where the Makefile resides. As mentioned above, you
also can override some configuration options here:

	make prefix=/opt install

for example. But keep in mind that you need to remember these settings for the
case you want to uninstall later.


Uninstall
---------

is pretty much alike the install process. From the directory where the Makefile
resides, simply invoke:

	make uninstall

or, if you were overriding some options when calling "make install", you need
to specify the same here:

	make prefix=/opt uninstall

The uninstall process will remove everything it has installed - but nothing that
you created yourself later (usually; if you e.g. added a file to the
documentation directory in /usr/local/share/doc/<packagename>, this will be
removed as well since we remove the entire directory. You are not expected to
do modifications here) using this application, as e.g. template files, or
"personal" configuration files you created in your home directory.


Alternatives
------------

Alternatively you can manually (un)install the package. Hints for this you
usually find in another file from the packages documentation - most likely one
named readme.txt or <packagename>.txt and residing in the doc/ sub directory.
