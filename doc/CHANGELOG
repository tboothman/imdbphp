-------------------
! `Title::yearspan()` - returned the incorrect end year sometimes
! `Title::mpaa_reason()`, `Title::parentalGuide()`, `Title::extReviews()`, `Title::languages_detailed()`, `Title::cast()`
! `Title::releaseInfo()` returning the wrong day/month #103
+ `Config::$ip_address` which lets you send a 'X-Forwarded-For' header to make imdb think you're using a different IP. This can be used to give better access to a country's titles.

-------------------
! Fix `Title::locations()`, `Title::crazy_credits()` and `Title::trailers()`. None were returning any results.

! same reason: imdb::votes(), imdb::country() and imdb::mpaa_reason()
! same reason, just a couple of days later: imdb rating
! imdb_person class: filmografies no longer listed movie names due to site changes
* imdb_person class: character names w/o id are listed again in filmografies
! IMDB started to sometimes pre- or postfix movie titles with "IMDb", becoming part of the title then
* imdb movie: plotoutline() did not work for unrated movies

v2.0.6 (08.07.2011)
-------------------
! next IMDB site changes: ratings
! imdb_person filmographies: quarters in years, e.g. 1924/II, lead to empty year
* imdb::awards(): minor adjustments by Qvist
! imdb_movielist: fixed the listing methods (were all broken by IMDB site changes some time ago)
+ movies (imdb+pilot): Added new method languages_detailed() to get detailed lang info (name, code and comment of languages used)

v2.0.4 (28.12.2010)
-------------------
! mdb_request.class.php ignored the IMDBPHP_CONFIG constant - fixed

-------------------
! some after-fixes for the last "big run" include imdb methods plotoutline(),
  runtime_all()
! same for imdb_person::name()
* imdb::plotoutline() was taken from storyline with the recent changes - fixed it up
+ but since we had a working storyline, that method was added as storyline()
! imdb::mainPictures() was also broken by the last site changes - fixed
! mdb_request class did not inherit force_agent and trigger_referer values from
  mdb_config and thus issued PHP notices

v2.0.2 (10.10.2010)
-------------------
! imdbsearch: some search results missed the year (if it was consisting of more than a plain
  year, e.g. something like "2001/II")
! imdb::prodNotes: lastUpdate was broken due to a site change
+ movies: added imdb::locations() to retrieve details on the filming locations.
  pilot::locations() is just a wrapper to this requiring full fallback configured.

  entry is part of a TV series

+ added config option to set up the user agent "manually"
! if an actor had a too long movie list, no results where shown (there seems to be
  a limitation in preg_match)
! HUGE SITE CHANGES ON IMDB! Thanks to your contributions, we got many stuff fixed
  in the imdb class: thumbphoto, ratevote, genres, cast, alsoknown, runtime_all,
  comment, comment_split, tagline, plotoutline, keywords, mpaa, mpaa_hist, mpaa_reason, prodNotes
! Same reason broke the imdb_person class almost completely.

* due to a request, the constant mdbconfig::pilot_imdbfill was turned into a

+ imdb::awards() has been added by Qvist (Tnx!) and tweaked by Izzy - the latter
  then also added pilot::awards() as wrapper to it (requires FULL_ACCESS)
* replaced mdb_config::pilot_imdbfallback_enabled by the global constant
  PILOT_IMDBFILL - which is defined in the default mdb_config.class.php only
  if it was not defined before

+ first extension added: basic functionality for MoviePilot
  (http://www.moviepilot.de/), supporting some movie functionality only

! imdb_person::filmograf was broken due to an inserted onClick() on IMDB.COM
* imdb_person::movies_actress() was causing false alert in tests
! fixed the imdb::trailers() method. Note that IMDB now only lists their own
  videos, so the imdb_trailers class is (currently) useless.
- removed the imdb_trailers class from checks. As IMDB seems to no longer
  list external trailers, they will either fail. The code for the class will
  remain in the repository for now - one never knows...
+ added new method imdb::keywords_all() (to retrieve the full list). For
  compatibility, pilot:keywords_all() has been added (aliases pilot::keywords())

* test/ directory has been missing in Makefile, and "make uninstall" left some
  files on the system
+ added version and revision info to the classes (to be shown with the test page
  results)
+ let the test page prepend "." and ".." to PHPs include_path so it runs out of
  the box

-------------------
! preventing endless loops on connection problems (i.e. IMDB site offline)
! failed pages are no longer cached
+ added the attribute lastServerResponse (3-digit codes according to RFC2616)
  to the imdb_base class. You can check this to find out why there have been
  no results - e.g. "404" means the page was not found. "000" usually means
  the server could not be contacted (site down, network problems, ...)
