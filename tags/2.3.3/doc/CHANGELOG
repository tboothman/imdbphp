+ imdb_person::filmograf() now fills the "addons" information again (for all movie_*() methods)
! imdb_person: articles(), interviews() returned garbage if that information was not available
! Moviepilot changed API-error message, so instead of displaying the according error we had empty result sets

-------------------
! bunch of IMDB changes broke things again: fixed imdb::votes(), imdb::movietype(), imdb::country(), imdb::genres(), imdb::mpaa_reason()
! same reason: fixed imdb::thumbphoto() -- and thus all dependent photo methods resolve again
! same reason, more fixes: imdb::keywords()
! same reason, fixed imdb::seasons() -- which implicitly fixed the depending imdb::episodes()
! four more: fixed imdb::is_serial() and imdb::get_episode_details() plus imdb::comment() and imdb::comment_split() due to IMDB site changes

+ imdb::get_episode_details() - added "airdate" as requested by ticket:290
! imdb::goofs() and imdb::crazy_credits() where broken due to site changes
* some adjustments to imdb::trivia - spoilers are now avoided by default. Pass TRUE as only argument to retrieve them separately.
+ some enhancements to genre retrieval (thanks to George!) - now there will be more genres reported :)

v2.1.2 (19.01.2012)
-------------------
! site changes broke the imdb class methods keywords(), seasons(), languages(), mpaa_reason(), goofs()

! company info URLs were just the IMDB relative URL w/o protocol and site. Added the missing info

* imdb_person class: character names w/o id are listed again in filmografies

  year, e.g. something like "2001/II")

  pilot::locations() is just a wrapper to this requiring full fallback configured.
! mpaa_reason returned wrong text (tnx to dblume for report and fix!)
+ added method is_serial() to the movie classes to determine whether the selected
  entry is part of a TV series

  in the imdb class: thumbphoto, ratevote, genres, cast, alsoknown, runtime_all,
  comment, comment_split, tagline, plotoutline, keywords, mpaa, mpaa_hist, mpaa_reason, prodNotes

* due to a request, the constant mdbconfig::pilot_imdbfill was turned into a

  Passing TRUE as parameter, instead of simply the URLs you get some additional data

+ imdb::awards() has been added by Qvist (Tnx!) and tweaked by Izzy - the latter
  then also added pilot::awards() as wrapper to it (requires FULL_ACCESS)
* replaced mdb_config::pilot_imdbfallback_enabled by the global constant
  PILOT_IMDBFILL - which is defined in the default mdb_config.class.php only
  if it was not defined before

+ first extension added: basic functionality for MoviePilot
  (http://www.moviepilot.de/), supporting some movie functionality only

! imdb_person::filmograf was broken due to an inserted onClick() on IMDB.COM
* imdb_person::movies_actress() was causing false alert in tests
! fixed the imdb::trailers() method. Note that IMDB now only lists their own
  videos, so the imdb_trailers class is (currently) useless.
- removed the imdb_trailers class from checks. As IMDB seems to no longer
  list external trailers, they will either fail. The code for the class will
  remain in the repository for now - one never knows...
+ added new method imdb::keywords_all() (to retrieve the full list). For
  compatibility, pilot:keywords_all() has been added (aliases pilot::keywords())

* test/ directory has been missing in Makefile, and "make uninstall" left some
  files on the system
+ added version and revision info to the classes (to be shown with the test page
  results)
+ let the test page prepend "." and ".." to PHPs include_path so it runs out of
  the box

  items were not available on the corresponding page

v1.0.6 (11.06.2008)
-------------------
! preventing endless loops on connection problems (i.e. IMDB site offline)
! failed pages are no longer cached
+ added the attribute lastServerResponse (3-digit codes according to RFC2616)
  to the imdb_base class. You can check this to find out why there have been
  no results - e.g. "404" means the page was not found. "000" usually means
  the server could not be contacted (site down, network problems, ...)
+ test pages now allow to turn the cache on/off via the URL, applying
  "?cache=on" or "?cache=off" to it

-------------------
+ new method mpaa_reason() reports why the movie was rated PG-* in the USA
+ introduced new class imdb_person with methods to retrieve name, picture
  and filmographies of staff members

-------------------
* renamed imdb_config.php to imdb_config.class.php
* updated cache page layout
* changed Makefile: the classfiles now go to /usr/share/php which is the PHP
  include_path in the distributions php.ini - this means you no longer need

  only one term in parenthesis
