  you use PEAR.

  setsearchname($name).
+ a imdbsearchurl($url) was added that can be used to find the imdb links on
  a url. (ie. to get the top 250 movies.)
* many functions that returned an empty string now return NULL. this will
  propably not affect many programs but it is cleaner for databases.
  haven't fixed all of them yet.
* PEARs HTTP_Request class is now used (see pear.php.net you need it now for
  the program to run.)
* the default is not to use or store cache now.
