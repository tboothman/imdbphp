  distributors, special effects, other companies)
+ movie: added method to retrieve the synopsis
+ movie: added method to retrieve detailed parental guide info

v1.1.1 (26.01.2009)
-------------------

  (or even returned garbage in some cases) due to site changes
! names::spouse() and names::salary() returned garbage if the corresponding
  items were not available on the corresponding page
! trailer::getFlashCodeAllTrailers() was broken due to site changes on alltrailers.net
+ collecting more details from the filmografie - all the remarks in parenthesis
  are now collected into the $addons array

-------------------
+ added the imdb_topcharts and imdb_nowplaying classes provided by banzap
+ added imdb_trailers class (rewrite of code provided by banzap)
+ added showtimes images locally (since they are somehow protected at the IMDB site)
+ added name (imdb person) search

v1.0.8 (17.09.2008)
-------------------
! fixing strange problem with filmographies sometimes missing some years in the
  middle (just fixed by an ugly work-around - still not sure what is broken)

  to the imdb_base class. You can check this to find out why there have been
  no results - e.g. "404" means the page was not found. "000" usually means
  the server could not be contacted (site down, network problems, ...)
+ test pages now allow to turn the cache on/off via the URL, applying
  "?cache=on" or "?cache=off" to it

  a movie or an episode by the given name
